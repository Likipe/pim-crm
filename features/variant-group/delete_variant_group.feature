  In order to manager variant groups for the catalog
  As a user
  I need to be able to delete variant groups

  Background:
    Given there is no product group
    And the following families:
      | code      | label     |
      | mug       | Mug       |

    And the following product attributes:

      | POSTIT  | size  | Size  | simpleselect | no       | no           | no       |
    And the following "color" attribute options: Yellow, Blue, Green and Red
    And the following "size" attribute options: XS, S, M, L and XL
    And the following product values:
      | product | attribute | value |

    And the following product groups:
      | code   | label      | attributes  | type    |
      | MUG    | MUG Akeneo | color       | VARIANT |
      | POSTIT | Postit     | color, size | VARIANT |
    And I am logged in as "admin"

  Scenario: Successfully delete a variant group from the grid
    Given I am on the variant groups page
    And I should see group MUG
    When I click on the "Delete" action of the row which contains "MUG"
    And I confirm the deletion
    Then the grid should contain 1 element
    And I should not see group "MUG"

  Scenario: Successfully delete a variant group
    Given I edit the "POSTIT" variant group
    When I press the "Delete" button
    And I confirm the deletion
    Then the grid should contain 1 element
    And I should not see group "POSTIT"
